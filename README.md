Dealer On test task (bootstrap3, jquery)

# Frontend Web Designer Test Task

This repository contains the completed test task for the company Dealer On. The task was completed using Bootstrap 3 and jQuery, which meet the company's requirements. The maximum allowed time for this task was used – 3 hours.

Test completion date: February 2025.

I assume that the company uses outdated technologies with no future prospects, but I completed the test. Unfortunately, the company did not provide any feedback, and I did not get the role.
